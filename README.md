# Simple SSH tool
thanks to [nlohmann/json](https://github.com/nlohmann/json) for the JSON intergration!

## Features
- Easy SSH connection
- Save multiple profiles with host, port, username
- Profiles stored locally in JSON
- Default host `localhost` and port `2222`
- Simple menu-based interface

## How do I compile myself?
Since all binary's used in this code are included in the src, compiling the program should be quite easy!
- Make sure you have Visual Studio 2022 installed and open the .sln file in the zip you got.
- Then the compiler setting should already be right and you can just use ctrl + B to build!
